# Develop a program to visualise the 3D wireframe models.

## The program provide the ability to:

+ Load a wireframe model from an obj file (vertices and surfaces list support only).
+ Translate the model by a given distance in relation to the X, Y, Z axes.
+ Rotate the model by a given angle in relation to its X, Y, Z axes.
+ Scale the model by a given value.

## The graphical user interface contain:

+ A button to select the model file and a field to output its name.
+ A visualisation area for the wireframe model.
+ Button/buttons and input fields for translating the model.
+ Button/buttons and input fields for rotating the model.
+ Button/buttons and input fields for scaling the model.
+ Information about the uploaded model - file name, number of vertices and edges.
